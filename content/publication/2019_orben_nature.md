abstract = "If science had generations, mine would not be defined by war or Woodstock, but by reproducibility and open science. Early-career researchers such as myself have been trained in an era when scientists are acutely aware of problems in the scientific process. We are taught about replication issues and failures, and are encouraged to question results that have been left unchallenged for decades. Our ability to connect through social media lets us sidestep conventional hierarchies and scrutinize current research practices. Of course, we want to adapt how we do research to improve the scientific landscape that we will be navigating for decades."
